# Python Password Generator

## Overview ðŸ“‹

1.A Python password generator developed using the Python language and the Tkinter module is a tool that generates random and secure passwords based on the given length of the password. The tool is built using the Python language, which is a powerful and versatile programming language. The Tkinter module is used to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the tool, which allows users to interact with the tool in a user-friendly way.

2.The password generator allows users to specify the length of their desired password and the complexity of the password, such as the inclusion of special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters. Users can also choose to use specific characters in the password. Once the user has specified the desired password parameters, they can click on the "Generate" button to generate a random password.

3.The generated password is then displayed on the screen, and the user has the option to add the password to an SQLite database by clicking on the "Add" button. This allows users to save the generated password for future reference. The SQLite database is used to store the password and other details like date of creation, username and notes.

4.The goal of the tool is to help users create secure and unique passwords for their accounts, and to increase the security of their online activities. The tool also helps users to organize and manage their passwords in one place.
